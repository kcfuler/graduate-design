# Task Description
Integrate Ultralytics YOLO models into the Traffic Sign Recognition application.

# Project Overview
The project is a Gradio-based web application for traffic sign recognition. It uses a ModelFactory pattern to load and manage different recognition models. The main application logic is in `app/main.py`, model definitions are in `app/models/`, including a base model interface (`app/models/base.py`) and a factory (`app/models/__init__.py`).

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)
- The application uses a `ModelFactory` (`app/models/__init__.py`) to manage models based on registration.
- Models must adhere to the `BaseModel` interface defined in `app/models/base.py`.
- `BaseModel` defines `load_model`, `preprocess`, `postprocess`, and `predict` methods.
- The standard `predict` workflow is `preprocess` -> `model()` -> `postprocess`.
- The expected output of `predict` is `List[Dict[str, Any]]` containing detection/classification details.
- Currently, only `MobileNetModel` is registered.
- Ultralytics YOLO models are loaded via `ultralytics.YOLO()`.
- YOLO prediction is done via `model(image)`, returning a results object.
- YOLO models might handle pre/post-processing internally, potentially conflicting with the `BaseModel`'s separate steps. Requires the `ultralytics` package dependency.

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)
- **Option 1:** Directly handle YOLO loading in `ModelFactory`. 
    - Pros: Might seem simpler initially.
    - Cons: Breaks `BaseModel` interface consistency, requires conditional logic in `app/main.py`, harder to maintain.
- **Option 2:** Create a `YOLOModel` adapter class inheriting from/implementing the `BaseModel` interface.
    - Sub-option 2a: Implement `preprocess` to pass through, `postprocess` to parse YOLO results.
    - Sub-option 2b: Override the `predict` method entirely to call `ultralytics.YOLO` instance directly and parse results. `load_model` would load the YOLO instance. `preprocess`/`postprocess` could be minimal/empty.
    - Pros: Encapsulates YOLO specifics, maintains interface consistency for the factory and app, cleaner structure.
    - Cons: Requires creating a new class file.
- **Favored Solution:** Option 2b. Create `app/models/yolo_model.py` with a `YOLOModel` class that overrides the `predict` method to directly use the loaded `ultralytics.YOLO` model and format its output to match the expected `List[Dict[str, Any]]` structure. Implement `load_model` to load the YOLO model. Other methods like `preprocess`, `postprocess` will be implemented minimally as required by the base class but won't be central to the overridden prediction logic.

# Implementation Plan (Generated by PLAN mode)
## Error Correction Plan 2 (Following User Report - AttributeError)
1.  **File**: `app/models/imagenet_classes.txt` (New)
    *   **Rationale**: Provide class names for the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.
    *   **Change**: Create file with 1000 ImageNet class names, one per line.
2.  **File**: `app/models/mobilenet.py`
    *   **Rationale**: Load class names during initialization *before* `load_model` is called via `super().__init__`.
    *   **Change**: In `MobileNetModel.__init__`, add code *before* `super().__init__` to load class names from `imagenet_classes.txt` into `self.class_names`, with error handling.

Implementation Checklist:
1. Create `app/models/imagenet_classes.txt` with ImageNet class names.
2. Modify `app/models/mobilenet.py`: Load class names into `self.class_names` in `__init__` before `super().__init__()`.
